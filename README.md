This repository demonstrates an uncommon VHDL coding error that can lead to unintended latches. The bug involves a process where a signal is not assigned a value in all possible execution paths. This can cause the synthesis tool to infer latches instead of the intended behavior. The `bug.vhdl` file contains the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.vhdl` provides a corrected version.
